<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Yafi Al Arkan — a passionate learner currently diving into the world of web development. 
  While my academic background is in Management at Diponegoro University, 
  my curiosity for technology has led me to explore coding, design, and everything that 
  brings ideas to life on the web.</p>

<p>I'm driven by a love for continuous learning, and I find joy in turning 
  complex problems into simple, elegant solutions. Outside of building 
  websites and learning new tech skills, I enjoy reading, which helps me 
  expand my perspective and fuel my creativity.</p>
